# Covid-19-Vaccine-Wastage---ICBAI-2021
An Indian District Level Case Study

This repository contains an academic research project that analyzes COVID 19 vaccine wastage across vaccination centers in Simdega district, Jharkhand, India. The study uses real vaccination data to identify operational inefficiencies, quantify wastage, and propose data driven interventions to improve vaccine utilization.

Project Overview

The objective of this study was to understand why vaccine wastage occurs at the ground level and how simple operational changes could significantly reduce it. The analysis focuses on open vial wastage, center performance, session size planning, and geographic optimization of vaccination centers.

Using district level data from public vaccination dashboards, the project evaluates performance across 78 centers over a 16 day period and benchmarks wastage against the recommended 10 percent threshold.

Key Highlights

• Analyzed vaccination data from all primary health centers in Simdega district
• Quantified wastage, average wastage, and center level performance
• Identified high and low performing centers using data analysis and visualization
• Used Excel and Tableau for trend analysis, mapping, and insights
• Designed actionable operational recommendations such as
• Consolidation of underperforming centers
• Optimized session sizing to reduce open vial wastage
• Mobile vaccination camp planning using geographic clustering
• Estimated that approximately 4.45 percent of vaccines could have been saved per center over 16 days through improved planning

Methodology

Root cause analysis using cause and effect diagrams

Data collection from public vaccination dashboards

Metric formulation for wastage and performance evaluation

Exploratory data analysis and visualization

Geographic mapping of vaccination centers

Operational scenario modeling for center consolidation and mobile drives

Tools and Skills Used

• Data analysis and interpretation
• Excel based computation and trend analysis
• Tableau dashboards and geographic visualization
• Operations research and industrial engineering principles
• Public health analytics and policy driven decision making

Impact

The findings demonstrate how data driven micro planning at the district level can lead to meaningful reductions in vaccine wastage, cost savings, and better public health outcomes. While the study focuses on a single district, the framework and insights are scalable and applicable to larger regions.
